# Conv3D - 3D convolution pipeline for the binding project

## General info
This is a usual PyTorch pipeline. The data is generated by another 
directory of this repo (binding-project). It is a list of 3D tensors
of features named following the PDBname_ligandID_ID.pdb convention.
The tensors are aligned to their eigen axis and some data analysis is conducted
in binding-project. 
There is also a dictionnary mapping the ligand ids to their embeddings
obtained in the cddd subproject.

The software requirements and version are stated in requirements.txt

## Data
Mostly the dataset loader. The data is produced as u8 to get the most 
compressed representation, so it needs to be cast to floats.
We use the data alignment to eigen axis. Overall, this aligned 
representation enables us to reduce the possible poses of the ligand 
on the grid, which should improve learning as well as reduce the size
of the model. The grid size is chosen to keep almost all of the data
in a (40,30,30) grid. To get all rotation augmentation, and get data loading, 
we offer 3 approaches. We build the explicit enumeration of all 2**3 poses * n 
data points and then :
- loader constructs the tensor on the fly without too high of a time consumption,
to avoid memory overload
- loader_ram does this as a preprocessing step and loads the whole data on the RAM
- loader_hard assumes the whole list of input points was preprocessed and saved, so it
just loads them
- loader_hard_ram does the same as loader_hard but saves the result in the RAM

## Src
The training utilities. The logging uses tensorboard and the rest is pure pytorch.
Some helper functions can be found in utils.py (logging, model saving...), while the
machine learning pipeline is defined in learning.py

## models
The python definition of the modules we use

## logs
The dir to which logs are saved

## saved models
The serialised neural nets
