# Master Research

## cddd
Is the autoencoders ligand encoding by Robin Winter

## labels_benchmark
Is the use of these two outputs : we use Carlos project and compare its accuracy when using standard fingerprints and the output from cddd

## usrpcat
Introduces another embedding method closed to hand crafted features and benchmark it against previous USR techniques on the DUDE DB

## protein-binding
Do similar task as rna-ligand for proteins pockets. Returns pockets representations either using 3D point clouds or graphs
Implements the ligand list extraction tool to produce dict/csv : ligand , embedding

##CONV3D
Learning pipeline from pockets to ligand representations obtained through cddd
